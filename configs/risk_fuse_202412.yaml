# Risk fusion configuration for YM=202412
# This file is used by 'audit.data' and 'risk.fuse' CLI commands.

# Explicitly disable wave risk layer for this version, as it is not yet implemented.
# This will mark the missing R_wave as 'planned_disabled' in the audit report.
use_wave: false

# Optional: Define weights for the fusion process.
# If not provided, the system will use defaults (e.g., alpha=0.6, gamma=0.2, beta=0.2 renormalized).
weights:
  alpha: 0.7  # R_ice_eff
  gamma: 0.3  # R_acc
  beta: 0.0   # R_wave
